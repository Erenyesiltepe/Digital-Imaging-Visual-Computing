This notebook is a detailed guide for tackling the binary leaf recognition homework assignment. It includes everything from data preparation and feature extraction to implementing and evaluating machine learning models, including neural networks and ensemble methods.

Hereâ€™s how the provided sections help:

Data Preparation:

Loads binary leaf images and their corresponding labels.
Ensures the dataset is correctly structured for further analysis.
Feature Extraction:

Uses properties like area, perimeter, circularity, and Hu moments to describe the leaves.
Provides flexibility for working with either binary regions or contours.
Machine Learning Models:

Implements a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification.
Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualizes the training process and results with plots and confusion matrices.
Ensemble Methods:

Prepares features for models like Gradient Boosting Classifier.
Offers a robust alternative to neural networks for this classification task.
Evaluation:

Uses confusion matrices and classification reports to analyze model performance.
Highlights leaf classes that are easier or harder to distinguish, encouraging deeper analysis.
Suggestions for Improvement:
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Explore hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search for both MLP and ensemble methods.
Optimize learning rates, dropout rates, or the number of layers in the MLP.
Feature Scaling:

Standardize or normalize the extracted features to improve model performance.
Ensemble Learning:

Compare Gradient Boosting with Random Forests or XGBoost for performance evaluation.
Expanded Metrics:

Include metrics like AUC-ROC to better evaluate model robustness.
Additional Augmentation:

Simulate variations in scale, rotation, or noise to test model generalization.
